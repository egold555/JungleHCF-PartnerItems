# JungleHCF-PartnerItems
JungleHCF custom plugin I created requested by Auiy.

## What does this do?
Adds some new items to enhance the PVP experience.

## Releases 
Because this is a custom plugin, I am not releasing compiled jars of it. But, you can compile it your self. The only reason this is open-sourced is to show developers how I did certain things, in hope they can learn from what I made. I can't stop you from skidding, but if your going to copy this code, please at least try to learn what it does.
